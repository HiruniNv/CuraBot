# ⚕️ CuraBot: AI-Powered Medical Research Assistant

**CuraBot** is a full-stack AI agent application that bridges the gap between patient symptoms and peer-reviewed medical literature. Using **CrewAI** and **Llama 3.3 (via Groq)**, the system orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents to extract symptoms, search **PubMed**, and provide evidence-based summaries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Uses CrewAI to manage a Classifier, a Researcher, and a Safety Advisor.
- **Real-time Research:** Integrated with the NCBI PubMed API to fetch the latest medical abstracts.
- **High-Speed Inference:** Powered by Groq's Llama-3.3-70b model for high-quality medical reasoning.
- **Professional UI:** A clean, Streamlit-based dashboard for easy user interaction.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python
- **AI Framework:** CrewAI, LangChain
- **LLM:** Groq (Llama 3.3 70B)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Data Source:** BioPython (PubMed/Entrez)

⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CuraBot.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CuraBot.git)
cd CuraBot

2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
NCBI_EMAIL=your_email@example.com

3. Install Dependencies

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

🏃 How to Run
Step 1: Start the Backend (Terminal 1)

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

Step 2: Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)

streamlit run frontend/app.py

🔍 Troubleshooting
No analysis found: Ensure the Backend terminal is running and check for any Groq API rate limits.

Wait Time: Because the agents are performing live research on PubMed, it may take 30-60 seconds to generate a full report.

Environment Errors: Ensure you have selected the correct Python interpreter (venv) in VS Code.
