# ⚕️ CuraBot: AI-Powered Medical Research Assistant 🩺

## 📖 Description

**CuraBot** is an advanced agentic system designed to bridge the gap between user symptoms and peer-reviewed medical literature. By leveraging a **multi-agent architecture** and the **PubMed database**, it provides evidence-based research summaries to help users understand their health concerns through the lens of current medical science.

---

## 📝 Overview

This project provides a professional interface for medical research. When a user inputs symptoms, the system triggers a specialized pipeline of AI agents that perform live searches on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.

The final output is a structured **research report** derived from real-world medical abstracts, ensuring that the information provided is grounded in scientific data rather than just general AI knowledge.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Natural Language Processing**: Describe symptoms in plain English.
* **Live PubMed Integration**: Fetches real-time data using BioPython and the Entrez API.
* **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Managed by CrewAI to ensure a structured research workflow.
* **High-Speed Inference**: Powered by Llama 3.3 via Groq for rapid analysis.
* **Modern Dashboard**: A clean, responsive Streamlit interface for seamless user interaction.

---

## 🤖 System Architecture

CuraBot employs three specialized agents to handle the research lifecycle:

* **Medical Classifier Agent** 🧩
* Extracts key medical terms and symptoms from user input.
* Formats data into optimized search queries for medical databases.


* **PubMed Researcher Agent** 🔍
* Executes live searches on PubMed.
* Analyzes abstracts and filters for the most relevant scientific literature.


* **Safety & Summary Agent** 💡
* Synthesizes findings into a readable research summary.
* Ensures all responses include necessary safety warnings and evidence-based insights.
